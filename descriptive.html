            <h3>Excellence of Cauayan in Debate Posiklaban</h3>
            <p>The debate featured three major topics: divorce, euthanasia, and the possible abolition of the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK). In both the divorce and euthanasia rounds, the negative teams won by defending the sanctity of marriage and the value of life. During the championship round, the debate focused on whether the SK should be abolished. The negative side argued that the SK provides important youth representation, while the affirmative side claimed it promotes corruption.
               After intense arguments, the fourth group emerged as overall champion, and Julius Ceasar Cauayan was recognized as Best Debator. The event successfully highlighted important social and political issues while developing students’ public speaking and critical thinking skills.
